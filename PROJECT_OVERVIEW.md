## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
```
React 18 + TypeScript
├── Vite (Build Tool)
├── Tailwind CSS (Styling)
├── shadcn/ui (Component Library)
├── React Router (Navigation)
├── React Query (Data Management)
└── Lucide React (Icons)
```

### Backend Architecture
```
Supabase Backend-as-a-Service
├── PostgreSQL Database
├── Authentication System
├── Row Level Security (RLS)
├── Edge Functions (Serverless)
├── Real-time Subscriptions
└── Cron Jobs
```

### External Integrations
- **Resend API**: Email notification service
- **Cashify Website**: Target platform for price scraping

## 📊 Database Design

### Core Tables

#### `tracked_products`
- **Purpose**: Store user's tracked products with current pricing information
- **Key Fields**: `id`, `user_id`, `product_url`, `current_price`, `alert_price`, `product_data`
- **Relationships**: One-to-many with `price_history`

#### `price_history`
- **Purpose**: Historical price data for trend analysis
- **Key Fields**: `id`, `tracked_product_id`, `price`, `checked_at`
- **Relationships**: Many-to-one with `tracked_products`

### Security Model
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Ensures data isolation between users
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password
- **Access Control**: User-specific data access through RLS policies

## 🔄 Application Workflow

### 1. User Onboarding
```
User Registration → Email Verification → Dashboard Access
```

### 2. Product Tracking Setup
```
Paste Cashify URL → Scrape Product Data → Set Alert Price → Save to Database
```

### 3. Automated Monitoring
```
Hourly Cron Job → Scrape Current Prices → Update Database → Check Alert Conditions → Send Notifications
```

### 4. User Interaction
```
View Dashboard → Monitor Price History → Receive Alerts → Make Purchase Decisions
```

## 🛠️ Key Features Implementation

### Price Scraping System
- **Technology**: Cheerio for HTML parsing
- **Frequency**: Hourly automated checks
